Problem Statement
Third Eye Project
According to the WHO, about 30 million people are estimated to be
permanently blind worldwide. These people are totally dependent on
others. We have created designed and built an “Ultrasonic Third Eye
Project” device which will help blind people to walk with ease
independently. As a simpler version, we have used only one ultrasonic
sensor in this project. For better accuracy and assistance two or three
sensors can be used.
Objective
To help blind people to walk with ease and to be warned whenever their
walking path is obstructed with other objects, people or other similar
odds. As a warning signal, a Bluetooth device is connected in the circuit,
whose gives alarming sound according to the distance of object.

# Ultrasonic Sensor
The main component used for this device is the ultrasonic sensor. The
ultrasonic sensor transmits a high frequency sound pulse and then
calculates the time to receive the signal of the sound echo to reflect
back. The sensor has 2 circles. One of them acts as the transmitter and
transmits the ultrasonic waves. The other one acts as a receiver (mostly a
small microphone) and receives the echoed sound signal. The sensor is
calibrated according to the speed of the sound in air. With this calibrated
input, the time difference between the transmission and reception of
sound pulse is determined to calculate the distance of the object
